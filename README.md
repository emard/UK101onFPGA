# UK101onFPGA

A fork of Grant Seale's great work
for emulation of Compukit UK101 on FPGA
downloaded from UK101 page at http://searle.hostei.com/grant/uk101FPGA/index.html

UK101 is used as the base for emulating ORAO computer on FPGA.

ORAO was created as an upgrade of GALEB with 
256x256 bitmap graphics framebuffer and more RAM.
GALEB has been also known as YU101.
YU101 was UK101 compatible.
